  title: A concise explanation of nil v. empty v. blank in Ruby on Rails
  description: "I find myself repeatedly looking for a clear definition of the differences
    of nil?, blank?, and empty? in Ruby on Rails. Here's the closest I've come:\r\n\r\nblank?
    objects are false, empty, or a whitespace string. For example, \"\", \" \", nil,
    [], and {} are blank.\r\n\r\nnil? objects are instances of NilClass.\r\n\r\nempty?
    objects are classspecific, and the definition varies from class to class. A string
    is empty if it has no characters, and an array is empty if it contains no items.\r\n\r\nIs
    there anything missing, or a tighter comparison that can be made?"
